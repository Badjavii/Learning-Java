<!--! What is Java? !-->

<h2 align="center">What is Java?</h2>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

<!--! Historical Background !-->

<h2 align="center">Historical Background</h2>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
    <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java platform was initially released with the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere," providing a robust, secure, and portable environment for applications.</p>
